Dotfiles for my Windows configuration.

## to use

Fork and clone the repo. Make any necessary changes - probably a good idea to make sure `alias` and `path` will work on another machine.

Either run `apply.bat` (cmd) or `source apply` (bash) to copy the files to your user directory.

If updates are made to any of the files in your user directory, run `update.bat` or `source update` to update the records in the local git repo.
